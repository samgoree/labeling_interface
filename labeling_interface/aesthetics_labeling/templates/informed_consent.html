<h1>INDIANA UNIVERSITY INFORMED CONSENT STATEMENT FOR RESEARCH</h1>
<h2>Personalized Image Quality Assessment</h2>
<h4>IRB #12423</h4>

<p>You are being asked to participate in a research study. Scientists do research to answer important questions that might help change or improve the way we do things in the future. This consent form will give you information about the study to help you decide whether you want to participate. Please read this form, and ask any questions you have, before agreeing to be in the study. All research is voluntary. You can choose not to take part in this study. If you decide to participate, you can change your mind later and leave the study at any time. You will not be penalized or lose any benefits if you decide not to participate or choose to leave the study later.</p>
    
<p>The purpose of this study is to understand how visual cues and preferences for images vary from person to person, and how to build better algorithms for modeling those preferences. The study is being conducted by Samuel Goree, Weslie Khoo, Professor David Crandall and the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering. If you agree to be in the study, you will do the following things.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Participate in a one-time online survey which consists of demographic and psychometric questions and questions about your ratings for images.</li>
    <li>The survey will take no longer than 30 minutes in total.</li>
</ul>


<p>Before agreeing to participate, please consider the risks and potential benefits of taking part in this study.</p>

<p>You may be uncomfortable while answering the survey questions.</p>

<ul>
    <li>There is a risk that you may find some images in this survey containing sensitive, shocking, or offensive content even though we have taken steps to manually pre-screen all images to ensure that they are generally safe-for-work.</li>
    <li>There is a risk that answering many survey questions over a short period may make you uncomfortable.</li>
</ul>

<p>At any point during the survey, you are free to stop participating, or wait and come back during another time in the data collection period. To protect your confidentiality, your participation will only be known by the research team and all ensuing publications will anonymize any of your data used. There is a risk someone outside the study team could get access to your research information from this study. More information about how we will protect your information to reduce this risk is below. </p>

<p>Your email will not be linked to your responses in this survey. We ask for your email so we can pay you for your time to complete this survey. Your email will be stored in a secured server in Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering and will be disposed of at the conclusion of this survey study after it has been checked for duplicate entries.</p>

<p>You will be paid for participating in this study. You will be receiving a $10 gift card upon completion of the survey. Participation without completion of the survey will not receive compensation. There is no cost to participate in the study. We will protect your information and make every effort to keep your personal information confidential, but we cannot guarantee absolute confidentiality. No information which could identify you will be shared in publications about this study. Your personal information may be shared outside the research study if required by law. We also may need to share your research records with other groups for quality assurance or data analysis. These groups include the Indiana University Institutional Review Board or its designees, and state or federal agencies who may need to access the research records (as allowed by law). Information collected in this study may be used for other research studies or shared with other researchers for future research. If this happens, information that could identify you, such as your name and other identifiers, will be removed before any information or specimens are shared. Since identifying information will be removed, we will not ask for your additional consent. If you have questions about the study or encounter a problem with the research, contact the researchers, Samuel Goree, at sgoree@iu.edu or Weslie Khoo, at weskhoo@iu.edu. For questions about your rights as a research participant, to discuss problems, complaints, or concerns about a research study, or to obtain information or to offer input, please contact the IU Human Research Protection Program office at 800-696-2949 or at irb@iu.edu.</p>

<p>If you decide to participate in this study, you can change your mind and decide to leave the study at any time in during the survey without penalty and without loss of benefits. If you decide to withdraw, just close the survey at any point and no further action is needed on your part. </p>
